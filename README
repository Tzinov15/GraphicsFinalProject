Final Project
Rubiks Cube + Dynamic Classroom Setting



<><><> BEST VIEWS OF THE PROJECT: <><><>

Cycle between them by pressing:
0 (start view)
1 (small cube on side desk)
2 (focus on inner working of Rubiks cube)
3 (view from the ground with lower light source)
4 (CubeCeption! See the back corner cube through the hole of the main cube)


!! Movement outside of these scenes is supported, but project / visuals were
tailored and optimized to work within those 5 views !!

In any view, press:
s = remove lines from cube
f = remove everything from the cube except the core structure
c = remove the core structure

Combinations of these three yield interesting results! (ei: cube without core, cube with only core)

Project Highlights / Personal Achievements:
  - Animation / Transition from scene to scene: differences in old parameters
  (angle, position, fov, etc) vs new parameters are calculated, idle function is
  utilized to redraw scene periodically as we are "moving" to next location
  - Modularity of code/design: I wanted to be able to build up the cube part by
  part so that with keybindings, a user can quickly see how the cube is built by
  seeing separate parts individually
  - No help from any other software like Blender


Arrow Keys to change view angle!

Key bindings

  PERSPECTIVE / VIEW
  +/-        Changes field of view for perspective
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle

  SUN STUFF:
  z/Z        Change speed of sun and cube (need to become disjoint)
  d/D        Change distance of sun
  e/E        Change elevation of sun
  w          Pause the motion of the sun
  q          Pause the motion of the cube
  ><         (horizontal carrot keys) Revolve sun

  CAREFUL WITH MOVEMENT WITHIN THE SCENE. IT IS EASY TO "EXIT" THE ROOM. PRESS 0 TO RESET. THIS WILL BE FIXED
  j/k        Strafe to the left and right
  h/l        Move forwards and backwards within the scene
  ESC        Exit
